The project requires a set of math mini-games launched from the console.
There are 5 games in the package:
1. The essence of the game is as follows: a random number is shown to the user. And he needs to answer "yes" if the number is even, or "no" if it is odd.
you can start the game with the command brain-even

2. The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 20 + 10, which needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer.
you can start the game with the command brain-calc

3. The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the largest common factor of these numbers.
you can start the game with the command brain-gcd

4. The essence of the game is as follows: a random number is shown to the user, the user needs to determine whether this number is prime.
you can start the game with the command brain-prime

5. We show the player a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two points. The player must determine this number.
you can start the game with the command brain-progression
